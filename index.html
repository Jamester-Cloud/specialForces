            <h2>Operation Red Wings</h2>
            <p>Operation Red Wings, informally referred to as the Battle of Abbas Ghar (often incorrectly called "Operation Redwing" or "Operation Red Wing"),[2][3][7][11][12] was a combined / joint military operation during the War in Afghanistan in the Pech District of Afghanistan's Kunar Province, on the slopes of a mountain named Sawtalo Sar,[2][4][7] approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Kunar's provincial capital of Asadabad, in late June through mid-July 2005.[1][2][3] Operation Red Wings was intended to disrupt local Taliban anti-coalition militia (ACM) activity, thus contributing to regional stability and thereby facilitating the Afghan Parliament elections scheduled for September 2005.[1][2][3] At the time, Taliban anti-coalition militia activity in the region was carried out most notably by a small group, led by a local man from Nangarhar Province, Ahmad Shah, who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence. He and his small group were among the primary targets of the operation.

                <h3>SAS-Special Air Service - UK</h3>
                <p>The Special Air Service (SAS) is a special forces unit of the British Army. The SAS was founded in 1941 as a regiment, and later reconstituted as a corps in 1950.[5] The unit undertakes a number of roles including covert reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, direct action and hostage rescue. Much of the information and actions regarding the SAS is highly classified, and is not commented on by the British government or the Ministry of Defence due to the sensitivity of their operations.</p>

                <h3>GIGN- France</h3>
                <p>GIGN (Groupe d'intervention de la Gendarmerie nationale About this soundpronunciation (help·info); English: National Gendarmerie Intervention Group) is the elite police tactical unit of the French National Gendarmerie. Its missions include counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, surveillance of national threats, protection of government officials, and targeting organized crime.[3]

                GIGN was established in 1974 following the Munich massacre. Created initially as a relatively small tactical unit specialized in sensitive hostage situations, it has since grown into a larger and more diversified force of nearly 400 members,[4] with expanded responsibilities. GIGN shares jurisdiction of French territory with the National Police special-response units</p>

                <h2>Operation Nimrod</h2>
                <p>The Iranian Embassy siege took place from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after a group of six armed men stormed the Iranian embassy on Prince's Gate in South Kensington, London.  The British government quickly decided that safe passage would not be granted and a siege ensued. Subsequently, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers' demands on British television.</p>

                <p>Opération Harmattan was the codename for the French participation in the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[4] It was named for the Harmattan, which are hot dry winds that blow over the Sahara, mostly between November and March.[5] The United States' counterpart to this was Operation Odyssey Dawn, the Canadian counterpart was Operation Mobile and the British counterpart was Operation Ellamy. The no-fly zone was proposed during the Libyan Civil War to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi forces. Several countries prepared to take immediate military action at a conference in Paris on 19 March 2011</p>
